  <h2>Publication history</h2>
  <hr/>
  <h3>premiere</h3>
  <p class="mode">Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of superhero comic books, Marvel set about creating new superhero
     characters.[1] During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.[1] Lee was interested in making an unlikeable character likeable,
      saying that he "thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, none of [Marvel's] readers would like, and shove him down
       their throats and make them like him".[2] Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated 
       into the character's backstory.[3] The character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam in which Iron
        Man was created as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil".[4]
    As superhero comics became more popular, Marvel began replacing its previous comic book lines with superheroes. The monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense
     began running Iron Man stories alongside more traditional science-fiction and horror stories, featuring Iron Man on each cover.[5][6] Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron 
     Man is Born!", was in Tales of Suspense #39, released in December 1962 with a cover date of March 1963. In 1964, the science-fiction and horror stories were removed entirely,
      with the series running only Iron Man and Captain America stories.[6]

<h2>fictional character biography</h2>
<hr/>
<p class="gh">
The sixth and final category is outright fiction, the novel written as biography or autobiography. It has enjoyed brilliant successes.
Such works do not masquerade as lives; rather, they imaginatively take the place of biography where perhaps there can be no genuine life
writing for lack of materials. Among the most highly regarded examples of this genre are, in the guise of autobiography, Robert Graves’s 
books on the Roman emperor Claudius, I, Claudius and Claudius the God and His Wife Messalina; Mary Renault’s The King Must Die on the legendary
hero Theseus; and Marguerite Yourcenar’s Memoirs of Hadrian. The diary form of autobiography was amusingly used by George and Weedon Grossmith 
to tell the trials and tribulations of their fictional character Charles Pooter in The Diary of a Nobody (1892). In the form of biography this
category includes Graves’s Count Belisarius and Hope Muntz’s Golden Warrior (on Harold II, vanquished at the Battle of Hastings, 1066). Some
novels-as-biography, using fictional names, are designed to evoke rather than re-create an actual life, such as W. Somerset Maugham’s Moon
and Sixpence (Paul Gauguin) and Cakes and Ale (Thomas Hardy) and Robert Penn Warren’s All the King’s Men (Huey Long).
